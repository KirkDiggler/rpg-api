# RPG API Client Commands

These commands allow you to test the RPG API by making real gRPC requests to the server.

## Prerequisites

1. Start the gRPC server:
```bash
./server server
```

2. The server runs on `localhost:50051` by default.

## Available Commands

### List Commands

**List all races:**
```bash
./server client list-races
./server client list-races --include-subraces=false  # Exclude subraces
```

**List all classes:**
```bash
./server client list-classes
./server client list-classes --spellcasters-only     # Only show spellcasting classes
./server client list-classes --include-features=false # Hide class features
```

**List all backgrounds:**
```bash
./server client list-backgrounds
```

### Get Commands

**Get specific race details:**
```bash
./server client get-race dwarf
./server client get-race half-orc
./server client get-race elf
```

**Get specific class details:**
```bash
./server client get-class wizard
./server client get-class fighter
./server client get-class rogue
```

## Connection Options

All commands support these flags:

- `--server`: gRPC server address (default: `localhost:50051`)
- `--timeout`: Request timeout (default: `30s`)

Example with custom server:
```bash
./server client list-races --server=api.example.com:50051 --timeout=10s
```

## Testing the External Client

These commands are perfect for testing that the external client integration is working correctly:

1. **Check basic connectivity:**
   ```bash
   ./server client list-races
   ```

2. **Verify caching is working** - Run the same command twice. The second call should be faster:
   ```bash
   time ./server client list-races
   time ./server client list-races  # Should be faster
   ```

3. **Test concurrent loading** - The list commands load all details concurrently:
   ```bash
   ./server client list-classes --include-features
   ```

4. **Test specific lookups:**
   ```bash
   ./server client get-race tiefling
   ./server client get-class paladin
   ```
