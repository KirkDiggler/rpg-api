# RPG API Client Commands

These commands allow you to test the RPG API by making real gRPC requests to the server.

## Prerequisites

1. Start the gRPC server:
```bash
./server server
```

2. The server runs on `localhost:50051` by default.

## Testing the External Client

These commands are perfect for testing that the external client integration is working correctly:

1. **Check basic connectivity:**
   ```bash
   ./server client list-races
   ```

2. **Verify caching is working** - Run the same command twice. The second call should be faster:
   ```bash
   time ./server client list-races
   time ./server client list-races  # Should be faster
   ```

3. **Test concurrent loading** - The list commands load all details concurrently:
   ```bash
   ./server client list-classes --include-features
   ```

4. **Test specific lookups:**
   ```bash
   ./server client get-race tiefling
   ./server client get-class paladin
   ```

5. **Test equipment and spell filtering:**
   ```bash
   ./server client list-equipment --type=simple-melee-weapons
   ./server client list-spells --level=0 --class=wizard
   ```

6. **Test pagination:**
   ```bash
   ./server client list-equipment --type=adventuring-gear --page-size=5
   ./server client list-spells --level=1 --page-size=3
   ```
