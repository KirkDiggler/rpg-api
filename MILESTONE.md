# Milestone Tracking

## Milestone 1: Foundation (In Progress)

### Completed âœ…
1. **Proto Definitions** - Complete Character Service API design
2. **gRPC Server Setup** - Basic server with health checks, middleware, and graceful shutdown

### Current Task ðŸš§
3. **Implement Character Service Handlers** - Create handlers that return "not implemented" errors
   - This allows early API testing while building out the implementation
   - Create service interface and mocks as we go

### Upcoming Tasks ðŸ“‹
4. **Entity Models** - Simple data structures for Character, CharacterDraft
5. **Repository Layer** - Interfaces and Redis implementation
6. **Orchestrator Layer** - Business logic and character creation flows
7. **Engine Integration** - Connect to rpg-toolkit for game mechanics

## Implementation Strategy

Starting with handlers that return "not implemented" allows us to:
- Test the gRPC API structure immediately
- Define service interfaces based on actual handler needs
- Create mocks incrementally as needed
- Follow true API-first development

## Future Milestones

### Milestone 3: Real-time Features
- gRPC streaming for live updates
- Pub/sub integration for multiplayer

### Milestone 4: Advanced Features
- Multiple ruleset support
