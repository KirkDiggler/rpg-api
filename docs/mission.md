# Mission Statement: AI-Driven Cooperative D&D

**We're building a procedurally generated D&D 5e campaign system where AI creates adventures tailored to each party's unique skills and proficiencies.**

## Core Vision

**No human DM required** - Claude/AI drives the entire narrative and makes all DM decisions in real-time.

**Procedural content generation** - Adventures, encounters, and story beats adapt dynamically to party composition and player choices.

**Every player matters** - Content is generated to leverage each character's specific proficiencies, backgrounds, and abilities.

**Cooperative campaign style** - Like Gloomhaven's structured campaign progression but with the full flexibility of D&D 5e rules.

## Example Scenario

A party consists of:
- **Cleric** with Religion proficiency
- **Wizard** with History proficiency  
- **Rogue** with Investigation proficiency

The AI generates an **ancient temple scenario** featuring:
- Religious symbols that only the Cleric can interpret (Religion checks)
- Historical murals revealing ancient civilizations (History checks)
- Hidden passages and secret compartments (Investigation checks)

Each player gets meaningful moments where their character build directly impacts story progression.

## What We're NOT Building

- **Traditional DM tools** - Plenty of excellent DM resources already exist
- **Generic adventures** - Cookie-cutter content that ignores character sheets
- **Human DM features** - May be a stretch goal, but not our primary focus

## What We ARE Building

- **AI that reads character sheets** - The system understands your proficiencies and creates content specifically for them
- **Procedural storytelling engine** - Every campaign is unique and tailored to the party
- **Meaningful character choices** - Your Religion background actually unlocks story paths and dialogue options
- **Adaptive difficulty** - Encounters and challenges scale based on party capabilities

## Technical Architecture

The system is built on a foundation of:
- **rpg-toolkit** - Handles all D&D 5e rules, calculations, and game mechanics
- **rpg-api** - Orchestrates data, state management, and API services
- **AI narrative engine** - Claude/AI generates content, makes story decisions, and adapts to player actions

## Success Metrics

We'll know we've succeeded when:
- Players feel their character choices matter in every session
- The AI creates compelling, personalized content that feels hand-crafted
- Groups can play rich D&D campaigns without needing a human DM
- Every proficiency, background, and character trait influences the story

*This mission statement serves as our north star. Every feature, API, and design decision should serve this vision of AI-driven, personalized D&D adventures.*
