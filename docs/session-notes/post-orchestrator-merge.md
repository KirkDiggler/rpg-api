# Session Notes: Post Character Orchestrator Merge

Date: 2025-01-13

## What We Accomplished

PR #18 has been merged! This was a major milestone implementing the character creation orchestrator.

### Key Achievements:
1. **Implemented all 15 character.Service methods** with full business logic
2. **Created all dependency interfaces**: repositories, engine, external client
3. **Achieved 70.4% test coverage** with comprehensive test suite
4. **Improved progress tracking**: Converted from 7 booleans to bitflags (memory efficient!)
5. **Clarified architecture**: Entities are data-only, all logic in rpg-toolkit
6. **Fixed pre-commit hooks**: Auto-runs EOF fixes, prevents broken commits

### Architectural Decisions Made:
- **Repositories use entities directly** (not Input/Output pattern) - matches existing code
- **Engine interface** defined for rpg-toolkit integration
- **Progress uses bitflags** for efficiency (see orchestrator README)
- **Entities have NO behavior** - just data (see ADR-002)

## Current State

### Completed:
- ✅ Issue #4: Character orchestrator implementation
- ✅ Handlers can now actually create/manage characters (no more Unimplemented!)
- ✅ All interfaces defined and mocked
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks properly configured

### Interfaces Ready for Implementation:
```go
// Ready to implement with Redis:
- CharacterRepository (internal/repositories/character/)
- CharacterDraftRepository (internal/repositories/character_draft/)

// Ready to wire up rpg-toolkit:
- Engine (internal/engine/)

// Ready to implement D&D 5e API client:
- ExternalClient (internal/clients/external/)
```

## Next Priority: Issue #19 - Error Handling

**This should be done BEFORE implementing repositories!** Why?
- Current errors are basic: `fmt.Errorf("failed to X: %w", err)`
- Need user-friendly messages
- Need proper error types (NotFound, InvalidArgument, etc.)
- Need gRPC status code mapping
- Will make all future implementations cleaner

## Clear Next Steps

1. **Issue #19: Comprehensive Error Handling** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Design error package with types and builders
   - Implement gRPC conversion utilities
   - Migrate orchestrator to use new errors
   - Document patterns for future code

2. **Issue #5: Character Repository with Redis**
   - Can use miniredis for testing
   - Follow existing session repository patterns
   - Remember: repositories use entities directly

3. **Issue #6: Character Draft Repository with Redis**
   - Similar to character repo but with draft lifecycle
   - Consider TTL for abandoned drafts
   - Track progress efficiently (we have bitflags now!)

4. **Issue #7: Wire up rpg-toolkit engine adapter**
   - Implement the engine interface we defined
   - Map our data structures to toolkit's domain models
   - Handle all the calculations we documented

5. **Issue #8: External client for D&D 5e API**
   - For race/class/background reference data
   - Consider caching strategy
   - Handle API failures gracefully

## Important Reminders

### Always Run Pre-commit!
```bash
make install-hooks  # One time setup
# Then commits automatically run checks
```

### Architecture Boundaries:
- **Handlers**: Simple translation layer (proto ↔ service)
- **Orchestrators**: ALL business logic lives here
- **Repositories**: Dumb storage (just CRUD)
- **Engine**: All D&D calculations (via rpg-toolkit)
- **Entities**: Data only, NO methods!

### Testing Patterns:
- Use explicit mock expectations (not DoAndReturn)
- Test error paths thoroughly
- Suite-based tests with proper setup/teardown
- Integration tests with miniredis where possible

## Session Metrics

- **Commits**: 8 (including improvements during review)
- **Files Changed**: 30+
- **Lines Added**: ~3,500
- **Test Coverage**: 70.4% on orchestrator
- **Documentation**: 6 new docs (ADRs, journey, session notes)

## Questions for Next Time

1. Should draft repositories have automatic TTL cleanup?
2. How should we handle race/class data caching from external API?
3. Should character IDs be UUIDs or something more memorable?
4. How do we want to handle character "templates" in the future?

## Final State

The path forward is clear:
1. Error handling infrastructure (Issue #19)
2. Repository implementations (Issues #5, #6)
3. External integrations (Issues #7, #8)
4. Integration tests (Issue #9)

Each piece has defined interfaces and clear boundaries. The orchestrator tests serve as a contract for what repositories need to provide.

**We're ready to build the persistence and integration layers!**
