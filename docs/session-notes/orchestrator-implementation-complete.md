# Session Notes: Character Orchestrator Implementation Complete

Date: 2025-01-13

## Summary

Successfully implemented Issue #4: Character Creation Orchestrator with comprehensive test coverage.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Orchestrator Structure
- `/internal/orchestrators/character/` package created
- Implements the `character.Service` interface
- All 15 service methods implemented

### 2. Defined Dependencies
Created interfaces for all orchestrator dependencies:
- **Character Repository** (`/internal/repositories/character/`)
- **Character Draft Repository** (`/internal/repositories/character_draft/`)  
- **Engine Interface** (`/internal/engine/`) - rpg-toolkit wrapper
- **External Client** (`/internal/clients/external/`) - D&D 5e API wrapper

### 3. Implemented Business Logic
All methods implemented with proper:
- Input validation
- Repository delegation
- Engine validation calls
- Progress tracking
- Error handling and wrapping

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite
- Created orchestrator tests using testify suite
- Achieved 70.4% code coverage
- All tests passing
- Mocked all dependencies

### 5. Documentation
- Updated `/internal/README.md` to clarify services vs orchestrators
- Created `/internal/orchestrators/README.md` for scope boundaries
- Created character orchestrator README
- Added testing best practices documentation
- Documented the mock parameter validation discovery

## Key Discoveries

### Mock Parameter Validation
Discovered that using `DoAndReturn` with `gomock.Any()` was hiding type issues:
- Tests passed with wrong types
- Runtime panics instead of compile-time errors
- Led to establishing best practice: prefer explicit parameter matching

### Engine Interface Requirements
Through implementation, discovered what the engine needs to provide:
- Race/class/background validation
- Ability score validation  
- Skill choice validation
- Full draft validation
- Character stat calculations

### Repository Pattern
Confirmed repositories use entities directly (not Input/Output pattern) which differs from CLAUDE.md guidance but matches existing code.

## Testing Insights

### Coverage Analysis
- Draft lifecycle methods: ~90% coverage
- Section updates: ~80% coverage
- Validation/finalization: ~79% coverage
- Missing: UpdateBackground, ListCharacters tests

### Test Patterns Established
- Suite-based testing with common fixtures
- Explicit mock parameter matching
- Comprehensive error scenario testing
- Validation of business logic flows

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Create PR for Issue #4
2. Address linter issues if blocking
3. Get review and merge

### Future Work
1. **Issue #5**: Implement character repository with Redis
2. **Issue #7**: Wire up rpg-toolkit engine adapter
3. **Issue #9**: Integration tests for full flow

## Technical Decisions

1. **Progress Tracking**: Implemented automatic progress calculation based on completed fields
2. **Validation Strategy**: Non-blocking warnings vs blocking errors
3. **Draft Cleanup**: Best-effort deletion after finalization
4. **Skill Dependencies**: Clear skills when class/background changes

## Metrics

- **Files Created**: 12 (orchestrator, tests, interfaces, docs)
- **Lines of Code**: ~2,500
- **Test Coverage**: 70.4%
- **Methods Implemented**: 15
- **Tests Written**: 30+

## Commands for Next Time

```bash
# Run tests
go test ./internal/orchestrators/character -v -count=1

# Check coverage
go test ./internal/orchestrators/character -cover

# Run pre-commit
make pre-commit

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "feat: Implement character creation orchestrator (Issue #4)" \
  --body "Implements the character service orchestrator with all required methods"
```

## Reflections

The outside-in approach worked well:
1. Handler tests validated the contracts
2. Orchestrator implementation revealed dependency needs
3. Test-driven development caught design issues early
4. Documentation as we go helps maintain context

The mock parameter validation discovery was valuable - it will improve all future tests in the codebase.
