# Session Notes: Post Rulebook Isolation Merge

**Date**: 2025-01-13  
**PR #16**: Merged ✅  
**Issue #15**: Closed ✅  

## Current State

### What Just Happened
- Entities refactored from `internal/entities/` → `internal/entities/dnd5e/`
- All imports updated successfully
- PR merged cleanly into main
- Created follow-up Issue #17 for proto mapping refactoring (not urgent)

### Key Context
- **Issue #17 is NOT tech debt** - Current switch statements work fine
- Only becomes tech debt when we add more handlers/conversions
- The validated map pattern is interesting but not critical

## Two Paths Forward

### Option A: Proto Mapping Refactoring (Issue #17)
**Effort**: ~1 hour  
**Value**: Code cleanliness, learning new pattern
**When to do**: If you want a quick win or learning experience

### Option B: Character Orchestrator (Issue #4) 
**Effort**: 1-2 sessions  
**Value**: Core business logic, unblocks repository work
**When to do**: If you want to make progress on Milestone 1

## My Recommendation: Start Issue #4 (Orchestrator)

**Why:**
1. It's the next priority in the milestone
2. More valuable than refactoring working code  
3. Unblocks repository implementation
4. The mapping refactoring can wait until we have more handlers

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull

# For Orchestrator work:
git checkout -b feat/4-character-orchestrator
mkdir -p internal/orchestrators/character
touch internal/orchestrators/character/orchestrator.go
touch internal/orchestrators/character/orchestrator_test.go

# For Mapping refactor:
git checkout -b refactor/17-proto-mapping
```

## Orchestrator Implementation Checklist

If starting Issue #4, remember:
1. Service interface already exists in `internal/services/character/service.go`
2. All Input/Output types are defined
3. Need to implement all 13 methods
4. Start with simplest methods (Get, Delete) before complex ones (CreateDraft, ValidateDraft)
5. Mock repository for testing (repository not implemented yet)

## Architecture Reminder

```
Handler (✅ Done) → Orchestrator (Next) → Repository (Not yet)
                         ↓
                     Engine/RPG-Toolkit (Future)
```

The orchestrator is where ALL business logic lives!
