# Session Notes: Rulebook Isolation Architecture Complete

**Date**: 2025-01-13  
**Branch**: `refactor/15-rulebook-isolation-architecture`  
**PR**: https://github.com/KirkDiggler/rpg-api/pull/16  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - PR Created, Fixes #15

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Issue #15 - Rulebook-Specific Entity Architecture

**REFACTORING COMPLETE**: Entities moved from generic to D&D 5e specific package:

#### Structural Changes
- `internal/entities/character.go` → `internal/entities/dnd5e/character.go`
- `internal/entities/constants.go` → `internal/entities/dnd5e/constants.go`
- All imports updated to use `github.com/KirkDiggler/rpg-api/internal/entities/dnd5e`
- Package declaration changed from `package entities` to `package dnd5e`

#### No Breaking Changes
- All existing functionality preserved
- Tests continue to pass
- Build compiles successfully
- Service interfaces unchanged

### ✅ Linting Configuration Update

**Updated `.golangci.yml` to v2 format**:
- Added `version: "2"` declaration
- Changed from `disable-all: false` to `default: none`
- Removed typecheck from disabled linters (not needed with curated list)
- Updated issues section to use `exclude-dirs` instead of path exclusions

**Why**: golangci-lint v1.61.0 has compatibility issues with Go 1.24, causing typecheck to fail even when disabled

## Architecture Analysis: What Goes in Core

### Would Belong in `core/` (Universal Concepts)
1. **Sessions** - All RPGs have game sessions
2. **Players/Users** - Universal account management
3. **Chat/Messaging** - In-character vs out-of-character communication
4. **Media Storage** - Maps, handouts, character portraits
5. **Scheduling** - Session planning, availability tracking

### Would NOT Belong in `core/` (System-Specific)
1. **Characters** - Too different (D&D: Race/Class, Vampire: Clan/Generation)
2. **Combat Mechanics** - Vary wildly between systems
3. **Status Effects** - System-specific (D&D: poisoned, Vampire: blood hunger)
4. **Inventory** - Some systems don't even track equipment

**Decision**: Skip creating `core/` for now - premature with only one rulebook

## Key Files Modified

### Moved Files
```
internal/entities/character.go → internal/entities/dnd5e/character.go
internal/entities/constants.go → internal/entities/dnd5e/constants.go
```

### Updated Imports
```
internal/handlers/dnd5e/v1alpha1/handler.go
internal/handlers/dnd5e/v1alpha1/handler_test.go
internal/services/character/service.go
```

### Configuration
```
.golangci.yml - Updated to v2 format
```

## Next Priority: Orchestrator Implementation (Issue #4)

### Overview
**Goal**: Implement the business logic layer for character creation

### Key Tasks
1. Create `/internal/orchestrators/character/` package
2. Implement the `character.Service` interface defined in `/internal/services/character/service.go`
3. Add validation rules:
   - Class requirements (e.g., Wizards need 13+ INT)
   - Ability score limits (3-18 before racial modifiers)
   - Valid race/class combinations
4. Implement character creation workflow logic
5. Test with mocked repository

### Implementation Notes
- The service interface already exists with 13 methods
- All Input/Output types are already defined
- Need to create a `CharacterOrchestrator` struct that implements the interface
- Will need mock repository for testing (repository not implemented yet)

### Current Service Interface Methods to Implement
```go
// Draft lifecycle
CreateDraft, GetDraft, ListDrafts, DeleteDraft

// Section-based updates  
UpdateName, UpdateRace, UpdateClass, UpdateBackground, UpdateAbilityScores, UpdateSkills

// Validation & Finalization
ValidateDraft, FinalizeDraft

// Character operations
GetCharacter, ListCharacters, DeleteCharacter
```

## Session Summary

**Time**: ~45 minutes
**Result**: Successfully refactored entities to rulebook-specific architecture
**Next**: Start implementing orchestrator (Issue #4)

## Important Context for Next Session

1. **PR #16 Status**: Check if merged before starting new work
2. **Import Path**: All entity imports now use `internal/entities/dnd5e`
3. **No Core Package**: Decided not to create `core/` until second rulebook added
4. **Linting**: Tests pass but golangci-lint has Go 1.24 compatibility issues

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr view 16

# If merged, update main branch
git checkout main
git pull

# Create branch for orchestrator work
git checkout -b feat/4-character-orchestrator

# Start with orchestrator package
mkdir -p internal/orchestrators/character
```

**Ready to implement the business logic layer!**
