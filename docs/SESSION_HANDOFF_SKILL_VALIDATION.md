# Session Handoff - Post Skill Validation Implementation

## Current State
- **Branch**: `feat/skill-validation-37`
- **PR #44**: Implements skill validation with external data integration
- **Status**: Code complete, needs manual commit and push due to shell issue

## What Was Accomplished
1. âœ… Implemented ValidateSkillChoices with comprehensive validation
2. âœ… Implemented GetAvailableSkills for class/background skills
3. âœ… Added 100% test coverage for both methods
4. âœ… Fixed code review feedback:
   - Extracted magic string "class" to constant
   - Removed unused test fields
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with magic string guidance

## Pending Manual Steps
Due to shell snapshot issue, run these commands:
```bash
cd /home/kirk/personal/rpg-api
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: address code review feedback

- Extract magic string \"class\" to named constant skillSourceClass
- Remove unused raceData and raceError fields from testExternalClient
- Add magic string guidance to CLAUDE.md for future development"
git push
```

Then update PR #44 with the fixes.

## Next Steps After PR #44 Merge

### 1. Character Stats Calculation (#38)
This is the next logical step:
- Implement `CalculateCharacterStats` in engine adapter
- Calculate HP based on class hit die + CON modifier
- Calculate AC based on armor + DEX modifier
- Calculate initiative (DEX modifier)
- Calculate saving throws with proficiencies
- Calculate skill bonuses with proficiencies

### 2. Complete Character Draft Validation (#39)
The culmination of all validation work:
- Implement comprehensive `ValidateCharacterDraft`
- Check all required fields are filled
- Validate all interdependencies
- Return detailed validation results with missing steps

### 3. Background Validation (#36)
Still has a TODO in the code:
- Implement `ValidateBackgroundChoice`
- Need background data from external API
- Validate background selection
- Return skill proficiencies, languages, equipment

## Technical Debt to Address

### TODOs Without Issue Numbers
From the handoff document, these need GitHub issues:
1. `orchestrator.go:520` - Make ability score method configurable
2. `orchestrator.go:847` - Implement pagination if needed
3. `cmd/server/server.go` - Replace with real service implementation

### Skill Data Enhancement
Current implementation has temporary solutions:
- `formatSkillName` - Basic snake_case to Title Case conversion
- `getSkillAbility` - Hardcoded skill-to-ability mapping
- These should eventually come from the dnd5e-api external data source

## Architecture Patterns Established

### External Client Pattern
Successfully proven through race, class, and skill validation:
1. Define what we need in the interface
2. Mock returns reveal exact API requirements
3. Clear contract for dnd5e-api implementation

### Validation Pattern
Comprehensive approach established:
1. Nil input checks with InvalidArgument errors
2. Required field validation
3. External data fetching with graceful error handling
4. Business logic validation
5. Warnings for optimization hints
6. Clear error codes and messages

### Magic String Elimination
Now documented in CLAUDE.md:
- Extract all string literals to constants
- Prevents typos and improves maintainability
- Applied to sources, types, error codes, etc.

## Key Learnings

### Skill System Complexity
- Skills can come from multiple sources (class choices vs background grants)
- Background skills are automatic, not choices
- Overlap warnings help optimize character builds
- Count validation ensures correct number of selections

### Testing Patterns
- Create configurable test clients for specific scenarios
- Test edge cases thoroughly (duplicates, invalid selections, etc.)
- Maintain high coverage (86.4% for rpgtoolkit package)
- Use nolint comments judiciously for intentional patterns

## Questions for Next Session

1. **Skill Expertise**: How will we handle expertise (double proficiency) in the future?
2. **Multiclassing Skills**: How do skill choices work with multiclassing?
3. **Custom Skills**: Will we support homebrew skills beyond SRD?
4. **Skill Descriptions**: Should we add detailed descriptions from source material?

## Environment Notes
- Shell snapshot issue encountered: `snapshot-zsh-c7ed5d1a.sh`
- Should be resolved in next session with fresh shell
- All code changes are applied, just need git commands

## Handoff Checklist
- [ ] Manually commit and push the review feedback fixes
- [ ] Ensure PR #44 CI passes
- [ ] Ready to start on issue #38 (Character Stats)
- [ ] Consider creating issues for technical debt items

## Final Note
The skill validation implementation is complete and follows all established patterns. The external client integration continues to work well, generating clear requirements for the dnd5e-api project. The codebase maintains high quality with comprehensive tests and clear documentation.

Keep following the patterns, eliminate magic strings, and maintain high test coverage! ðŸš€
