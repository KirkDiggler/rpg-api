# Session Handoff - Post PR #43

## Current State
- **Branch**: `feat/race-class-validation-36`
- **PR #43**: Implements race and class validation with external data integration
- **Status**: Ready to merge, includes fix for "result or error, never neither" rule

## What Was Accomplished
1. âœ… Implemented ValidateRaceChoice with external API integration
2. âœ… Implemented ValidateClassChoice with external API integration  
3. âœ… Added external client dependency to engine adapter
4. âœ… Fixed code to follow "result or error, never neither" rule
5. âœ… Created journey documentation for architectural decisions

## Next Steps After Merge

### 1. Immediate Next Issue: Skill Validation (#37)
Based on the pattern established, the next logical step is implementing skill validation:
- `ValidateSkillChoices` method in engine adapter
- `GetAvailableSkills` method to return class/background skill options
- Will need to integrate with class and background data

### 2. Character Stats Calculation (#38)
After skills, implement the actual stat calculations:
- Hit points based on class hit die + CON modifier
- Armor class calculations
- Initiative bonus
- Saving throw calculations with proficiencies

### 3. Complete Character Draft Validation (#39)
The big one - pull it all together:
- Validate all required fields are filled
- Check all interdependencies (race/class/background/skills)
- Return comprehensive validation results

## Key Learnings to Remember

### "Result or Error, Never Neither" Rule
Functions must return EITHER:
- A valid result with `err == nil`, OR
- An error with result as zero value

Never return `nil, nil` - this eliminates defensive programming.

### External Client Pattern
The outside-in approach worked perfectly:
1. Define interface based on needs
2. Use mocks to implement functionality
3. Mock usage reveals exact API requirements for dnd5e-api project

### Proto Imports
Getting protos from `rpg-api-protos@generated` is working correctly - the import paths are intentional.

## Technical Debt Tracking

### Well-Tracked TODOs (with issues):
- `TODO(#36)`: Race/class validation âœ… (this PR)
- `TODO(#37)`: Skill validation (next up)
- `TODO(#38)`: Character stat calculations
- `TODO(#39)`: Complete draft validation

### Actual TODOs Without Issues Found:
```go
// orchestrator.go:520
Method: "standard_array", // TODO: Make this configurable

// orchestrator.go:847  
// TODO: implement pagination if needed

// cmd/server/server.go
// TODO: Replace with real service implementation
```
These should get GitHub issues created.

**Note**: The many TODOs in adapter.go without issue numbers are actually part of the larger tracked issues (#36-39) and represent implementation notes within those features.

## Environment Setup for Next Session

1. **Merge PR #43** first
2. **Pull latest main**: `git checkout main && git pull`
3. **Create new branch**: `git checkout -b feat/skill-validation-37`
4. **Run health check**: `make pre-commit`

## Architecture Reminders

### What's Working Well:
- Input/Output pattern everywhere âœ…
- Clean separation of concerns âœ…
- Engine abstraction for game rules âœ…
- Repository pattern with proper interfaces âœ…
- Comprehensive documentation âœ…

### Patterns to Continue:
1. Start with engine interface method signature
2. Implement with external client calls
3. Write tests with proper stubs
4. Document architectural decisions
5. Follow "result or error" rule strictly

## Questions for Next Session

1. **Skill Prerequisites**: Do we need to validate class/background prerequisites for skills?
2. **Skill Expertise**: How do we handle expertise (double proficiency)?
3. **Custom Skills**: Do we support homebrew skills or just SRD?

## Handoff Checklist

Before starting next session:
- [ ] PR #43 is merged
- [ ] On latest main branch
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No uncommitted changes
- [ ] Ready to tackle issue #37

## Final Note

The codebase is in excellent shape. The patterns are well-established and consistently followed. The external client integration approach is proving very successful for implementing D&D 5e rules without coupling to specific implementations.

Keep following the established patterns and the quality will remain high! ðŸš€
