# Issue #24: golangci-lint False Positives with Testify Suites

## Problem
golangci-lint v1.61.0 is reporting false positives for testify suite embedded methods like `s.Run()`, `s.Assert()`, etc.

```
internal/errors/errors_test.go:44:5: s.Run undefined (type *ErrorsTestSuite has no field or method Run) (typecheck)
```

## Evidence Tests Are Correct
```bash
✅ go test ./internal/errors/... -v     # PASS (29 tests)
✅ go test ./internal/orchestrators/... -v  # PASS (47 tests)
```

The code compiles and runs perfectly. This is a linter configuration issue, not a code issue.

## Comparison with dnd-bot-discord
You mentioned dnd-bot-discord uses testify suites and golangci-lint successfully. Possible differences:
- **Version**: dnd-bot-discord might use different golangci-lint version
- **Config**: Different exclude rules or linter settings
- **Dependencies**: Different testify or Go versions

## Investigation Needed
1. Check golangci-lint version in dnd-bot-discord
2. Compare .golangci.yml configurations
3. Check if testify suite usage patterns differ

## Current Status
- **Tests**: ✅ All passing
- **Code**: ✅ Functionally correct 
- **Linter**: ❌ False positives only
- **Impact**: Blocks commit hooks but not functionality

## Temporary Solution
Given that:
1. Tests prove code is correct
2. This is clearly a linter config issue
3. dnd-bot-discord solved this problem
4. User needs to proceed with error handling implementation

**Recommendation**: Fix linter config separately from error handling implementation.

## Next Steps
1. Create separate branch to investigate/fix linter config
2. Compare with dnd-bot-discord configuration  
3. Potentially update golangci-lint version
4. Update exclude rules based on working configuration

This issue should not block the error handling implementation PR since the code is proven correct.
